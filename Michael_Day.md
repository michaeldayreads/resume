## Summary
My first program (in BASIC, age 12) was a “security system” written on a Commodore 128 with a gutted Atari 2600 controller and Radio Shack wire monitoring the opening of my bedroom door, windows, closet and drawers. Since finding my way back to technology a few years ago I've grown from tech support, to sales engineering, and then to small full stack projects, using my non tech experience to keep me connected to user's needs.
