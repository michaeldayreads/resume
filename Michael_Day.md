## Objective

Obtain a full time position in DevOps, backend engineering, or automated/pen test engineering at a dog friendly office in Boulder, Colorado or working remotely. Background and interests are in the network, infrastructure and privacy / security spheres, and opportunities to work with Open Source projects and the Rust programming language are especially interesting.

## Summary
My first program (in BASIC, age 12) was a “security system” written on a Commodore 128 with a gutted Atari 2600 controller and Radio Shack wire monitoring the opening of my bedroom door, windows, closet and drawers. Years later, after working in academics, sales, and mechanical shops I rediscovered technology, starting in tech support and growing through sales engineering, small full stack projects, then PHP and Ruby SaaS. Presently I work on test, tooling, and some product code for cloud infrastructure platforms aimed at DevOps, NetOps and SecOps users.

## Some Past Projects
- Seeded an Open source Helm Chart project for NetOps and served as first maintainer.
- Moved multiple projects from closed source internal GitLab instance to GitHub Open Source while under active development.
- Multiple instances of extending REST APIs in two SaaS products to drive key account acquisition and retention.
- Extended customer facing application scripting language and added Encrypted PDF functionality to a SaaS web form product.
- Implemented SAML 2.0 SSO integration in application for 30,000 user base client.
- Numerous API to custom dashboard or API to API data manipulation or integration projects.

## Technologies  
- Python; including pytest and behave, Bash, Golang, Docker, Kubernetes, git, gitlab CI/CD & API, RESTful/SOAP APIs, SQL (Intermediate; daily use.)
- Node JS, Ruby/Rails, PHP, Travis CI, Jenkins CI, MongoDB, Casandra, jQuery, CSS, & HTML (Familiar; past use.)
- C, Java, Rust. (Interested; personal projects only.)
